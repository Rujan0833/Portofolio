# 🌐 Personal Portfolio

My personal portfolio website built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.
Clean, minimal, and functional.

🔗 **Live Site:** [https://rujanrajlawat.com.np](https://rujanrajlawat.com.np)

## 🚀 Built With

* **Next.js** – React framework for production
* **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework
* **Resend** – Email delivery with secure contact forms
* **TypeScript** – Type safety (because I like my code not breaking)

---

## 💡 What's Inside

This portfolio showcases:

* My projects and work
* Skills and tech stack
* A bit about me
* Ways to get in touch

Nothing over-engineered. Just a simple, responsive site that gets the job done.

## 🤔 Why I Built This

Every developer needs a place to show their work. This is mine.
Simple, fast, and to the point.

It also serves as a space to experiment with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** whenever I feel like adding something new.
