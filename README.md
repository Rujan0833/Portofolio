🌐 Personal Portfolio

My personal portfolio website built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Nothing fancy, just clean and functional.
Live Site: rujanrajlawat.com.np

🚀 Built With

Next.js - React framework for production
Tailwind CSS - Utility-first CSS framework
TypeScript - Type safety (because I like my code not breaking)


💡 What's Inside

This portfolio showcases:

My projects and work
Skills and tech stack
A bit about me
Ways to get in touch

Nothing over-engineered. Just a simple, responsive site that gets the job done.

🤔 Why I Built This

Every developer needs a place to show off their work, right? This is mine. Simple, fast, and to the point.
Plus, it's a good excuse to experiment with Next.js and Tailwind whenever I feel like adding something new.

📝 License

Feel free to fork this and use it as inspiration for your own portfolio. Just don't copy it word-for-word - that's boring.

Built with ☕ and late nights by Rujan
